### Project: PowerCards

PowerCards enable university students to input a pool of information (question-answer pairs) of their desired topic and utilize the application to practice active recall of this information.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:  Add and edit a deck in MasterDeck. (PR [#59](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/61), [#91](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/91))
    * What it does: Allows users to add a new deck on the MasterDeck and edit its name, question, answer, or tag.
    * Justification: Allowing to add a new deck is an essential feature and very first command from user. Editing a deck information allows users to manage their decks simply. 
    * Highlights: Added basic feature of PowerCards based on the understanding of the code structure.
