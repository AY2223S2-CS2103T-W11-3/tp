## 1.2. Key Terms

**Deck**<br>

A deck refers to a collection of flashcards that are organized together based on a specific topic or subject.
For example, you might create a deck of flashcards to study for a math test, with each card containing a different math problem and solution.

**Card**<br>

A card refers to a flashcard within a deck. A card contains a question or prompt, and the corresponding answer or solution.
During a review session, the card will only show the question, encouraging you to actively recall the answer.
Once you attempt the question, you can command the card to reveal the answer and test your knowledge.

**Tag**<br>

A tag refers to the level of difficulty (easy/medium/hard) you can assign to each card. It helps you prioritize your study time and focus on the flashcards that are more challenging or require more review.
A card can only have at most one tag at any time.

## 3.1. Command Components

This section explains some common components you may find in a command.

| Component                 | Example              | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Parameter**             | `QUESTION`, `ANSWER` | Parameters are placeholders where you have to insert your input.<br/> <br/>Suppose `add q\QUESTION a\ANSWER` is a valid command to add a card. You can simply replace `QUESTION` and `ANSWER` with the question and answer of your choice.                                                                               |  
| **Prefix**                | `q\ `, `a\ `, `t\ `  | Prefixes are used to identify the parameters of a command. <br><br> For example, prefix `q\ ` identifies the parameter `QUESTION` in the command `add q\QUESTION`.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Optional Component**    | `[t\TAG]`            | Optional components can be **omitted** in certain commands.<br/> <br/>For example, `add q\QUESTION a\QUESTION [t\TAG]` is a valid command to add a card.<br><br>The first two components `q\QUESTION`, `a\ANSWER` are compulsory.<br>The last component `t\TAG` is optional.                                             |
| **Multi-value Parameter** | `KEYWORDS...`        | These are parameters that can appear **multiple times**. <br><br> For example, the command `findCards KEYWORD...` filters all the cards based on the keywords specified.<br><br>This means that the parameter `KEYWORD` can:<br>- Appear one time: `findCards cell`<br>- Appear multiple times: `findCards cell biology` | 
| **Index**                 | `INDEX`              | Index refers to the index of the card/deck you want to target from the list. The index must be positive integer (1, 2, 3...). <br/> <br/>For example, `deleteDeck 1` deletes the first deck in the deck list.                                                                                                            |
| **Flag**                  | `-e`, `-m`, `-h`     | Flags are used to toggle a particular setting or behavior.<br/><br/> For example, `review 1 -e` lets you review questions in the first deck that are tagged as **easy** only.                                                                                                                                            |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be considered.
  e.g. if you specify `q\What is photosynthesis q\What is a cell`, only `q\What is a cell` will be considered.
- Extraneous parameters succeeding commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. e.g. if the command specified is `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

## 3.3. Main Mode - Before Selecting a Deck

### 3.3.1. Adding a Deck : `addDeck`

Before you can add any cards, you must first create a deck. Creating a deck is done through the simple command below. 

Format: `addDeck DECK_NAME`
- `DECK_NAME` is the name of the deck you want to create. 
  - Deck name cannot be duplicated, e.g., if you already have a deck named Science, you cannot create another Science deck.
  - You do not need any prefix before deck name.

Example:
* `addDeck Science` will create a deck titled Science.

### 3.3.2. Editing a Deck : `editDeck`

You just created a deck, but you realised you made a typo! Fret not, you can easily edit the name of the deck with this command.  

Editing a deck name will not affect the cards stored inside it.

Format: `editDeck INDEX DECK_NAME`
- `INDEX` is the index of the deck you want to edit.
- `DECK_NAME` is the new name you want to assign to the specified deck.
  - The new deck name cannot be the name of an existing deck.

Example: 
- `editDeck 1 Chemistry` will edit the name of the first deck in the deck list to Chemistry.

### 3.3.3. Deleting a Deck : `deleteDeck`

Once you have no use for a deck, you can delete the deck and all the cards within it with this command.  

Be careful, a deck once deleted cannot be retrieved! 

Format: `deleteDeck INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the deck in the deck list.

Example: `deleteDeck 1` deletes the deck at index 1 and all the cards in deck 1. 

### 3.3.4. Finding a Deck : `findDecks`

If you want to find a specific deck among the many decks you have created, use this command to filter the decks based on their deck names!

Format: `findDecks KEYWORD...`
- You can include multiple KEYWORDS - as long as a deck's name contains at least one keyword, the deck will be found.
- At least one KEYWORD must be given.
- This command does not support partial words, e.g., `findDecks program` will not return the same list of decks as `findDecks programming`, despite "program" being a partial word of "programming".
- Keywords are case-insensitive. `findDecks programming` and `findDecks PROGRAMMING` will return the same filtered decks.

Example:
- `findDecks CS2103T software` filters decks whose names match keywords "CS2103T" and "software".

### 3.3.5. Showing all Decks : `showDecks`

After you filtered the decks using `findDecks`, you can see all the existing decks again using this command.

Format: `showDecks`

### 3.3.6. Selecting a Deck : `selectDeck`

Once a deck has been created, you can access the list of cards inside it with this command. 
Refer to the [Main Mode - After Selecting a Deck](#Main-Mode---After-Selecting-a-Deck) section to find out what commands you can run with a deck selected!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** <br>

- A deck can be selected and accessed anytime as long as you are in the Main Mode.
- This means you can switch to different deck while already selecting another deck!

</div>

Format: `selectDeck INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the deck in the deck list.

Examples:
* `selectDeck 2` will select the deck at index 2. 
  * The cards in this deck (if exist) will be displayed on the right panel. 

### 3.3.7. Clearing the data : `clear`

Perhaps you want to start over and create new sets of decks and cards. 
This command clears all the existing decks and their associated cards from the application database. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**<br>
This command is irreversible! You cannot retrieve your data after executing this command.

</div>

Format: `clear`
- Upon executing the command, a pop-up alert will appear and request you to confirm your decision.

![clear confirm](./images/ClearConfirm.png)

- Selecting `Yes` will clear all data.  

## 3.4. Main Mode - After Selecting a Deck

With a deck selected, you can see all the cards in the deck on the right panel! 
Now you can interact with the cards in the selected deck.

Note that you will not be able to make any deck-related changes (e.g. `addDeck`, `deleteDeck`) until you unselect the current deck.

### 3.4.1. Adding a Card: `addCard`

This commands allow you to add a card to the **selected** deck. 

A card must contain a question, an answer, and an optional difficulty tag. 

Format: `addCard q\QUESTION a\ANSWER [t\TAG]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**<br>
- A tag can only be of value Easy, Medium, or Hard (**case-insensitive**). 
- Each card can have at most one tag.

</div> 

Examples:
* `addCard q\What is chemical symbol for Oxygen? a\O` adds an untagged card with the given question and answer to the deck.
* `addCard q\What is gravity? a\A force of attraction between objects due to their mass t\Easy` adds a card tagged as Easy with the given question and answer to the deck.

### 3.4.2. Deleting a Card : `deleteCard`

You can easily delete an existing card from the current selected deck with this command. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:**
Note that this is irreversible!
</div>

Format: `deleteCard INDEX`
* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`. The card's index can be found in the displayed card list.

Example:
- `deleteCard 2` will delete the 2nd card in the deck.

### 3.4.3. Editing a Card : `editCard`

You realised you made some mistakes after creating a card. 
Worry not, as you can easily edit any existing card with this command!

* If the same prefix appears multiple times, only the last occurrence of the prefix will be considered. 

Examples:
* `editCard 1 q\What is chemical symbol for Carbon? a\C` edits the question and answer of the 1st card to be `What is chemical symbol for Carbon?` and `C` respectively.
* `edit 2 q\What is a recursion?` will only edit the question of the 2nd card to `What is a recursion?`. The other fields of the card (answer, tag) remain unchanged.
* `edit 3 q\What is a recursion? q\What is a loop?` edits the question of the 3rd card to be `What is a loop?`. 

### 3.4.4. Finding Cards by Keywords in Question : `findCards`

This command allows you to find specific flashcards you want to interact with based on the keyword(s) you enter.

It shows all the cards in the selected deck whose **questions** contain **any** of the given keyword(s).

You can interact with the filtered cards using their new indices, through commands such as `editCard` and `deleteCard`.

Format: `findCards KEYWORD...`
- You can include multiple KEYWORDS - as long as a card's question contains at least one keyword, the card will be found.
- At least one KEYWORD must be given.
- This command does not support partial words, e.g., `findCards partia` and `findCards partial` will **not** return the same result despite "partia" being a partial word of "partial". 
- Keywords are case-insensitive. `findCards what` and `findCards WHAT` will return the same filtered cards.

Example:
- `findCards loop recursion` shows all the cards whose questions match the keywords "loop" **or** "recursion".

### 3.4.5. Showing all Cards : `showCards`

After you filtered the cards using `findCards`, you can see all the cards in the selected deck again using this command.

Format: `showCards`

### 3.4.6. Unselecting a Deck : `unselectDeck`

If you want to make deck-related changes, you must first unselect the current deck you are in.
Refer to the [Main Mode - Before Selecting a Deck](#Main-Mode---Before-Selecting-a-Deck) section to find out what commands you can run without a deck selected!

This command allows you to unselect the currently selected deck.

Format: `unselectDeck`
- Upon unselecting a deck, you can no longer see the cards inside that deck.

## 3.5. Before entering Review Mode

### 3.5.1. Setting the Limit of Cards per Review: `setLimit`

Suppose you have a really long deck of cards, but you only want to test yourself on 20 cards this session. 
Use this function to set an upper limit on the number of cards per review.
While a limit is set, the review deck will be truncated to the card limit. 

You can set the limit back to 'none' to view all cards in the deck for future reviews.

Format: `setLimit LIMIT_NUM` or `setLimit none`
- LIMIT_NUM must be an integer between 1 and 2147483647 inclusive. 

Examples:
* `setLimit 30`
* `setLimit none`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.6. Review Mode

Once ready, you can enter the Review Mode to test yourself on the cards of a deck. You can also specify the difficulties of the cards of the deck you want to test - e.g. you just want test medium and hard cards only.

In the review mode, you will see:
- On the left panel - updated statistics of the current review (current deck, current card number, number of cards tagged each difficulty) and a navigation guide of the keys.
- On the right panel - the card that is currently under review, which you can flip to reveal the answer and then tag with a given difficulty.

To review a card, you can attempt the question on the card (in your mind or on a paper if you prefer!) before flipping it. 

Flipping a card reveals the answer - based on how close your guess was to the answer or how confident you were when attempting, you can tag the card with a difficulty of easy, medium or hard.

Your goal would be to eventually have all cards in a deck be tagged as easy!

### 3.6.1. Starting a Review: `review`
From the Main Mode, run this command to enter the Review Mode!

Format: `review INDEX [-e] [-m] [-h]`

* Reviews the cards from the deck with the specified INDEX. The deck's index can be found in the displayed deck list.
  - `-e` include this flag to test cards tagged as "easy"
  - `-m` include this flag to test cards tagged as "medium"
  - `-h` include this flag to test cards tagged as "hard"
  - Omit any flags to test all cards in the deck

Examples:
* `review 5 -e -h` lets you review all the cards tagged as Easy or Hard in the 5th deck.
* `review 2` lets you review all the cards in the 2nd deck.

### 3.6.2. Ending the Review: `endReview`

Ends the review and returns to the main mode. You can use this when you reach the end of the review deck or at any point during the review.

Format: `endReview`

### 3.6.3. Review Keystrokes

![ReviewKeystrokes](images/ReviewKeystrokes.png)

The diagram above shows the keystrokes you will use to interact with the cards in the Review mode. 
Notice that the keys are all close to the enter key so that you can breeze through decks of cards with ease!
- The top row of keys are commands to flip cards, or move to the previous/next cards. 
- The bottom row of keys are commands to tag the difficulty of the current card.
- You must press the enter key after typing in the command to execute it, e.g., pressing the key `p` alone will not flip the card. 

### 3.6.4. Flipping the Card: `p`

Flips the card to reveal the answer. 

Format: `p`
- `p` is case-insensitive (`P` is also excepted).
