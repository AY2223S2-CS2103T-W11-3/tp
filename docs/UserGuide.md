## Glossary

### Deck
A deck refers to a collection of flashcards that are organized together based on a specific topic or subject.
For example, you might create a deck of flashcards to study for a math test, with each card containing a different math problem and solution.

### Card
A card refers to a flashcard within a deck. A card contains a question or prompt, and the corresponding answer or solution.
During a review session, the card will only show the question, encouraging you to actively recall the answer.
Once you attempt the question, you can command the card to reveal the answer and test your knowledge.

## Command Components

This section explains some common components in a command.

| Component                 | Format                                            | Example              | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Parameter**             | `UPPER_CASE`                                      | `QUESTION`, `ANSWER` | Parameters are placeholders where you have to insert your input.<br/> <br/>Suppose `add q\QUESTION` is a valid command to add a card. You can simply replace `QUESTION` with a question of your choice.                                                                                                                  |  
| **Prefix**                | `lower_case\ `                                    | `q\ `, `a\ `, `t\ `  | Prefixes are used to identify the parameters of a command. <br><br> For example, prefix `q\ ` identifies the parameter `QUESTION` in the command `add q\QUESTION`.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Optional Component**    | `[components]`                                    | `[t\TAG]`            | Optional components can be obmitted in the certain commands.<br/> <br/>For example, `add q\QUESTION a\answer [t\TAG]` is a valid command to add a card.<br><br>The first two components `q\QUESTION`, `a\ANSWER` are compulsory.<br>The last component `t\TAG` is optional.                                              |
| **Multi-value Parameter** | `UPPER_CASE...`<br><br>`[UPPER_CASE]...`          | `KEYWORDS...`        | These are parameters that can appear **multiple times**. <br><br> For example, the command `findCards KEYWORD...` filters all the cards based on the keywords specified.<br><br>This means that the parameter `KEYWORD` can:<br>- Appear one time: `findCards cell`<br>- Appear multiple times: `findCards cell biology` | 
| **Index**                 | `INDEX`                                           | `INDEX`              | Index refers to the index of the card/deck you want to target from the list. The index must be positive integer (1, 2, 3...). <br/> <br/>For example, `deleteDeck 1` deletes the first deck in the deck list.                                                                                                            |
| **Flag**                  | `-lower_case`                                   	 | `-e`, `-m`, `-h`     | Flags are used to toggle a particular setting or behavior.<br/><br/> For example, `review 1 -e` lets you review questions in the first deck that are tagged as easy only.                                                                                                                                                |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be considered.
  e.g. if you specify `q\What is photosynthesis q\What is a cell`, only `q\What is a cell` will be considered.
- Extraneous parameters succeeding commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. e.g. if the command specified is `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

## Main Mode - Before Selecting a Deck

### Adding a new Deck : `addDeck`

Before you can add any cards, you must first create a deck. Creating a deck is done through the simple command below. 

Format: `addDeck DECK_NAME`
- `DECK_NAME` is the name of the deck you want to create. 
  - Deck name cannot be duplicated, e.g., if you already have a deck named Science, you cannot create another Science deck.
  - You do not need any prefix before deck name.

Example:
* `addDeck Science` will create a deck titled Science.

### Editing a Deck : `editDeck`

You just created a deck, but you realised you made a typo! Fret not, you can easily edit the name of the deck with this command.  

Editing a deck name will not affect the cards stored inside it.

Format: `editDeck INDEX DECK_NAME`
- `INDEX` is the index of the deck you want to edit.
- `DECK_NAME` is the new name you want to assign to the specified deck.
  - The new deck name cannot be the name of an existing deck.

Example: 
- `editDeck 1 Chemistry` will edit the name of the first deck in the deck list to Chemistry.

### Deleting a Deck : `deleteDeck`

Once you have no use for a deck, you can delete the deck and all the cards within it with this command.  

Be careful, a deck once deleted cannot be retrieved! 

Format: `deleteDeck INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the deck in the deck list.

Example: `deleteDeck 1` deletes the deck at index 1 and all the cards in deck 1. 

### Selecting a Deck : `selectDeck`

Once you have created your deck, you can access the list of cards inside it with this command.

Format: `selectDeck INDEX`
- `INDEX` is the index of the deck in the deck list.

Examples:
* `selectDeck 2` will select the deck at index 2. 
  * The cards in this deck (if exist) will be displayed on the right panel. 

## Main Mode - After Selecting a Deck

With a deck selected, you can see all the cards in the deck on the right panel! 
Now you can `addCard`, `deleteCard`, `editCard` or `findCards` in the deck.

You will not be able to make any deck-related changes (e.g. `addDeck`, `deleteDeck`) until you unselect the current deck.

### Unselecting a Deck : `unselectDeck`

Unselects the currently selected deck.

Format: `unselectDeck`

### Adding a Card: `addCard`

Adds a card to the **selected** deck.

Format: `addCard q\QUESTION a\ANSWER [t\TAG]`

Tagging is optional and should be of value Easy, Medium, or Hard.
</div> -->

Examples:
* `add q\What is chemical symbol for Oxygen? a\O`
* `add q\What is gravity? a\A force of attraction between objects due to their mass t\Easy`

### Deleting a Card : `deleteCard`

Deletes an existing card from the **selected** Deck. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Note that this is irreversible!
</div>

Format: `deleteCard INDEX`

* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`. The card's index can be found in the displayed card list.

Example:
- `deleteCard 2`

### Editing a Card : `editCard`

Edits an existing card in the **selected** Deck.

Format: `editCard INDEX [q\QUESTION] [a\ANSWER] [t\TAG]`

* Edits the card at the specified `INDEX`. The card's index can be found in the displayed card list.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

Examples:
*  `editCard 1 q\What is chemical symbol for Carbon? a\C` Edits the question and answer of the 1st card to be `What is chemical symbol for Carbon?` and `C` respectively.

### Finding Cards by Keywords in Question : `findCards`

Show only cards in the **selected** Deck with questions containing any of the given keyword(s).
Note that the find function does not support partial words.

Format: `findCards KEYWORD...`
- You can include multiple KEYWORDS - as long as a card's question contains at least one keyword, the card will be found
- At least one KEYWORD must be given.

### Showing all Cards : `showCards`

</div>

Format: `clear`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Review Mode

Once ready, you can enter the Review Mode to test yourself on the cards of a deck. You can also specify the difficulties of the cards of the deck you want to test - e.g. you just want test medium and hard cards only.

In the review mode, you will see:
- On the left panel - updated statistics of the current review (current deck, current card number, number of cards tagged each difficulty) and a navigation guide of the keys.
- On the right panel - the card that is currently under review, which you can flip to reveal the answer and then tag with a given difficulty.

To review a card, you can attempt the question on the card (in your mind or on a paper if you prefer!) before flipping it. 

Flipping a card reveals the answer - based on how close your guess was to the answer or how confident you were when attempting, you can tag the card with a difficulty of easy, medium or hard.

Your goal would be to eventually have all cards in a deck be tagged as easy!

### Setting the Limit of Cards per Review: `setLimit`

Sets an upper limit of the number of cards per review. 
The review deck will be truncated to the card limit in future reviews.

You can set the limit back to 'none' to view all cards in the deck for future reviews.

Format: `setLimit LIMIT_NUM` or `setLimit none`
- LIMIT_NUM is a non-zero positive integer

Examples:
* `setLimit 30`
* `setLimit none`

### Start a Review: `review`
From the Main Mode, run this command to enter the Review Mode!

Format: `review INDEX [-e] [-m] [-h]`

* Reviews the cards from the deck with the specified INDEX. The deck's index can be found in the displayed deck list.
  - `-e` include this flag to test cards tagged as "easy"
  - `-m` include this flag to test cards tagged as "medium"
  - `-h` include this flag to test cards tagged as "hard"
  - Omit any flags to test all cards in the deck

Examples:
* `review 5 -e -h`
* `review 2`

### Ending the Review: `endReview`

Ends the review and returns to the main mode. You can use this when you reach the end of the review deck or at any point during the review.

Format: `endReview`
